Different output formats:

- plain text
- markdown
- restructured text?

For markdown, attempt to "improve" the output:

- add headings (from text size in drawing)
- add bold (from brush thickness)
- improve lists (newlines before and after, space after "-" or "*")
- maybe gray text to italics(?)
- recognize paragraphs, add additional newlines

More control over recognition,
e.g. select specific pages
or section (BBox) from a page

Later
support different backends for HWR service

log output: include the language

write output to text, not markdown
alternative: result to stdout
